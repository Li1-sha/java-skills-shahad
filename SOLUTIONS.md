## Task 2: Basic Java Programming
- **What I learned:**  
  I reinforced my understanding of Java classes, access modifiers, constructors, getters/setters, and control structures like `switch`.
  Handling multiple employee types with different pay rules carefully in `PayrollCalculator`.
  I would like to improve my use of unit tests (e.g., using JUnit) in the future.

## Task 3: Working with Strings and Arrays
- **What I learned:**  
  I practiced string reversal, conditional checks, and using arrays effectively for managing student data. 
  Writing clean logic to find failing students while handling array iteration correctly.
  I would like to explore using `ArrayList` to simplify array manipulation.

## Task 4: Object-Oriented Programming
- **What I learned:**  
  I applied OOP concepts including inheritance, method overriding, and static vs non-static fields and methods.
  Implementing a good `displayInfo()` override that correctly extends base class functionality. 
  Created `Book` and `Textbook` objects in `Library` class and tested borrowing/returning logic.
  I plan to add user input.
